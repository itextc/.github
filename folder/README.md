# Islamic Text Copier
Islāmic Text Copier (**ITC** abbreviated) is an open-source, simple but very useful PC and Mac* program that allows you to easily copy islamic expressions in Arabic. You can either **click the text to copy it**, or **use hotkeys** such as *Alt + 1* for **ﷺ**, *Alt + 2* for **ﷻ**, etc. This is especially useful when **writing articles**.

Originally, I (`@nasiratif` made it just for myself to use to make writing articles easier, but decided to publish it as it would be useful for others as well.
